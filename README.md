What is the HTS?

The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) sets out the tariff rates and statistical categories for all merchandise imported into the United States. 

It is divided into chapters, each of which has a 2-digit number. Each product category within the various chapters is designated by 4, 6, 8, or 10 digits.
The 6- and 8-digit classifications are called “subheadings” and the 10-digit categories are “statistical reporting numbers.”
The HTS is a system for classifying traded goods based on their material composition, product name, and/or intended function.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the U.S. Government agency that officially determines the classification of imported goods using the HTS.

Now You Try Classifying a Product

To understand the HTS hierarchy and the basics of classification, it helps to review an example.

Where would we classify dried raisins?

1- First, start with Section II, Vegetable Products.  Within Section II are numerous chapters covering various vegetable products.

2- Chapter 8 covers “Edible Fruit and Nuts; Peel of Citrus Fruit or Melons,” which includes grapes and raisins. The numeric classification at the 4-digit level starts with 0801, which is the first entry in the Heading/Subheading column for this chapter.

3- We rule out heading 0801 (covering coconuts, Brazil nuts and cashew nuts), and continue looking through the 4-digit classifications until we see that heading 0806 covers “Grapes, fresh or dried.” That looks promising!! It is the most specific heading in the chapter, so we limit our effort to the provisions of this heading.

So, how do you know how to classify goods at the 6-digit, 8-digit and/or 10-digit level?
