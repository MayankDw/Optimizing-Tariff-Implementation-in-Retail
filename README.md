What is the HTS?

The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) sets out the tariff rates and statistical categories for all merchandise imported into the United States. 

It is divided into chapters, each of which has a 2-digit number. Each product category within the various chapters is designated by 4, 6, 8, or 10 digits.
The 6- and 8-digit classifications are called “subheadings” and the 10-digit categories are “statistical reporting numbers.”
The HTS is a system for classifying traded goods based on their material composition, product name, and/or intended function.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the U.S. Government agency that officially determines the classification of imported goods using the HTS.
