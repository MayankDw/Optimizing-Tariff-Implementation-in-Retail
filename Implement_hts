There are different methods by which the assessment is calculated. 
if an item is ordered there could be specific rate for the number of eaches orders then another ad valorem rate that could
applicable to number of eaches ordered and then 
there is another component i.e. value that value*secondary (or advalorem rate). suppose $1000. 1000*secondary rate

The secondary rate is taken as the proportion to the value of product ordered. A certain percentage of the values is designated
to be the ad valorem percentage. This is applicable for certain type of good. if $1000 worth of product is arrving a x% percetange 
of duty levied on the value of the product. 

The cost component is created and assigned one ID, that ID is associated to HTS code. The ID also holds the calculation method
if its specific rate, ad valorem rate or compound i.e. the sum of both.

Three different methods of calculation : 
Specific
Advalorem value
compound

The cost component ID plays an important role is application of tariff to product and to the purchase orders to estimate the 
cost of product for retailers.

clearing zones
This setup is need for the country that use clearing zones concept. Clearing zone are port of entry of importing country and rates, fee, tax could vary depending 
on the port good entered. The United states doesn't have this concept, same charges, tax, fee are applicables whether goods enter through california or New York.

HTS 1201.00.0000 has a Interior Zone duty rate of 20%

HTS Tariff :
charges applicable : Duty, Tax & Fee
Duty : DTYUS = DTY4AUS + DTY4BUS

    Freight: $1.50
    Insurance & Commission: $1.00
    Landed cost: $15.27
